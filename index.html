    <p>I am creating this new website to keep myself accountable 
        for making progress on various project ideas I have come up 
        with but not implemented yet. </p>
    <p>I will iteratively improve the style and layout of the webpage
        and turn this into a more blog-like format where I can record
        my progress. </p>
    <strong> Ideas: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Squash Computer Vision: Could be used to (1) automate referee-ing process,
                (2) gather simple statistics (helpful for players who cannot afford to bring
                coaches to tournaments @avi's mom)
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Squash RL simplified: Modified RL brickbreaker to be more like squash</p></li>
            <li><p>Squash swing prediction: use transformer architecture to take video of backswing
                and predict shot that will be hit by predicting next couple frames.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
